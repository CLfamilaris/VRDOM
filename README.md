# VRDOM
For the people who
- spent money on VR
- live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and can't just drive 5h to and from the nearest arcade

This is for that one funny 573 dance game with all those pretty lights. Still pretty WIP, the most basic stuff *should* work though.

# Building
Grab [Godot 4.1 with .NET support](https://godotengine.org/download/windows) and open the project. You may need to install the NuGet packages yourself.
